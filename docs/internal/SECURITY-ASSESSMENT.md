# RelayForge Security Assessment

**Document Status**: Internal/Confidential  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-27  
**Classification**: Security Architecture Review

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the security architecture, attack surface analysis, and implementation requirements for RelayForge's multi-tenant MCP service platform. The architecture requires MEDIUM-HIGH security effort with ongoing maintenance commitment.

## Attack Surface Analysis

### 1. Token Theft/Leakage (Critical Risk)

**Attack Vectors:**
- Memory dumps containing tokens
- Logs accidentally containing tokens  
- Process inspection revealing environment variables
- Side-channel attacks between users
- Token persistence in container

**Mitigations:**
- Tokens only in request headers (not environment variables)
- Zero token persistence policy
- Sanitized logging with token masking
- Memory scrubbing after requests
- Short-lived tokens (1 hour expiry)
- Token encryption at rest

### 2. Container Escape/Cross-Tenant Access

**Attack Scenario:** User A attempts to access User B's data via shared container state exploitation

**Mitigations:**
```yaml
containerIsolation:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  noNewPrivileges: true
  seccompProfile: "runtime/default"
  
requestIsolation:
  - Each request runs in isolated context
  - No shared memory between requests
  - Automatic garbage collection
  - Request-scoped variables only
```

### 3. OAuth Token Abuse

**Attack Vectors:**
- Token replay attacks
- Stolen tokens used elsewhere
- Excessive API calls draining quota
- Token refresh exploitation

**Mitigations:**
- Token binding to IP/User-Agent
- Rate limiting per user (100 req/min)
- Anomaly detection system
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Refresh token rotation
- Token revocation capability

### 4. MCP Protocol Exploits

**Attack Example:**
```json
{
  "method": "system.exec",
  "params": {
    "cmd": "cat /etc/passwd"
  }
}
```

**Mitigations:**
- Whitelist allowed MCP methods
- Strict input validation
- Parameter schema enforcement
- Command injection prevention
- Output sanitization

## Security Architecture Layers

### Layer 1: API Gateway Security

```typescript
class SecureGateway {
  async handleRequest(req: Request) {
    // 1. Rate limiting
    await rateLimiter.check(req.userId, req.ip);
    
    // 2. Token validation
    const token = await validateAndDecrypt(req.headers.authorization);
    
    // 3. User context verification
    if (token.userId !== req.params.userId) {
      throw new UnauthorizedError();
    }
    
    // 4. Request sanitization
    const sanitized = sanitizeRequest(req.body);
    
    // 5. Audit logging
    auditLog.record({
      userId: req.userId,
      action: req.method,
      ip: req.ip,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
  }
}
```

### Layer 2: OAuth Service Security

- Encryption at rest using AES-256
- Automatic token expiry (1 hour)
- Token refresh with rotation
- Secure key management
- Request context verification

### Layer 3: Container Security

```yaml
security_opt:
  - no-new-privileges:true
  - seccomp:seccomp/default.json
cap_drop:
  - ALL
cap_add:
  - NET_BIND_SERVICE
read_only: true
tmpfs:
  - /tmp
```

## Implementation Requirements

### High Effort Requirements

1. **Token Encryption Infrastructure**
   - Key management system (AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault)
   - Encryption at rest implementation
   - Secure key rotation mechanism
   - Estimated effort: 2 weeks

2. **Comprehensive Audit System**
   - All API calls logged with correlation IDs
   - Anomaly detection algorithms
   - SIEM integration
   - Estimated effort: 3 weeks

3. **Runtime Security**
   - Container vulnerability scanning
   - Real-time threat monitoring
   - Automated security patching
   - Estimated effort: 2 weeks

### Medium Effort Requirements

1. **Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection**
   - Redis-based rate limiting
   - CloudFlare or AWS WAF integration
   - Estimated effort: 1 week

2. **Input Validation Framework**
   - JSON schema validation
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS protection
   - Estimated effort: 1 week

3. **Secure Development Pipeline**
   - SAST/DAST integration
   - Dependency scanning
   - Security unit tests
   - Estimated effort: 1 week

## Security Stack Recommendations

### Minimum Viable Security
```json
{
  "authentication": "OAuth 2.0 with PKCE",
  "tokenStorage": "Encrypted Redis with TTL",
  "rateLimiting": "Redis-based per user/IP",
  "logging": "Structured logs to CloudWatch",
  "monitoring": "Datadog or New Relic",
  "secrets": "AWS Secrets Manager",
  "scanning": "Snyk or Trivy"
}
```

### Production Security Additions
```json
{
  "waf": "Cloudflare or AWS WAF",
  "ddos": "Cloudflare DDoS protection",
  "siem": "Splunk or ELK stack",
  "pentest": "Quarterly third-party assessment",
  "compliance": "SOC2 Type 2 certification",
  "insurance": "Cyber liability coverage"
}
```

## Ongoing Security Maintenance

### Daily Tasks
- Monitor security alerts and notifications
- Review anomalous activity patterns
- Check rate limit violations
- Respond to security incidents

### Weekly Tasks
- Update dependencies with security patches
- Review comprehensive audit logs
- Security patch assessment
- Vulnerability scan reviews

### Monthly Tasks
- Penetration testing (automated)
- Token rotation procedures
- Security training for team
- Security metrics review

### Quarterly Tasks
- Third-party penetration testing
- Security architecture review
- Compliance audit
- Incident response drills

## Risk Assessment Summary

**Overall Security Effort: MEDIUM-HIGH**

### Resource Requirements:
- **Initial Setup**: 2-3 weeks for basic security implementation
- **Ongoing Effort**: 20-30% of engineering time dedicated to security
- **Expertise Needed**: Security-aware developers, part-time security engineer
- **Tool Costs**: $500-2000/month for security tools and services

### Key Security Advantages:
1. Multi-tenant container design has smaller attack surface than per-user containers
2. Stateless architecture prevents data persistence vulnerabilities
3. Token injection pattern isolates authentication from business logic
4. Centralized security controls enable consistent policy enforcement

### Critical Success Factors:
1. Proper implementation of request isolation
2. Secure token management and encryption
3. Comprehensive audit logging
4. Regular security assessments
5. Security-first development culture
