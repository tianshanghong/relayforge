ðŸš€ **One URL. All MCP services. Pay per use.**

RelayForge is a hosted MCP server platform that provides access to multiple services through a single endpoint. Connect your AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor) once and access all available services.

## Problem

Setting up MCP servers requires:
- Pulling source code from various repositories
- Building and configuring each service
- Managing OAuth flows and authentication
- Maintaining local infrastructure
- Configuring multiple server URLs in your AI client

## Solution

RelayForge provides all MCP services through a single session-based endpoint:
```
https://relayforge.com/mcp/{session-id}
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **One URL**: Access all MCP services through a single endpoint
- **OAuth Handled**: We manage authentication for Google Calendar, GitHub, Slack, etc.
- **No Local Setup**: Use MCP servers without installing anything
- **Pay Per Use**: Only pay for what you use, transparent per-call pricing

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React app for account management and service discovery
- **Gateway**: Fastify-based router that directs requests to appropriate MCP servers
- **OAuth Service**: Centralized authentication management for OAuth-based services
- **MCP Servers**: Containerized implementations of various MCP services

## Getting Started

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development servers

```

### Production
